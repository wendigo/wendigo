### Hi there, fellow engineer 👋

I’m Mateusz “Serafin” Gajewski - Senior Staff Software Engineer, OSS Maintainer, and self-proclaimed Software Janitor [1] at [Starburst Data](https://starburst.io), the company behind Trino — a massively parallel, distributed, federated, ANSI SQL–compliant query engine.

You can find more details about me on my website [wendigo.pl](https://wendigo.pl) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateuszgajewski/).

Got a question? Just ask — I’m always happy to chat  🙂

[1] A janitor in the best sense: pointing people to the right doors, holding the keys to many places, and keeping everything tidy.
